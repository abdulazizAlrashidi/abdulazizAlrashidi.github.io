Hi! I'm a sophomore majoring in Computer Science (CSE) at Stony Brook University.

I'm interested in a variety of computer science topics, including: systems, algorithms, theoretical computer science, programming languages, software engineering, and cybersecurity. Systems, low-level stuff, and theoretical computer science are topics I enjoy the most.

I also enjoy travelling, gym, sport cars, and gaming.
